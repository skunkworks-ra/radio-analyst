"""
util/dispatch.py — Shared MCP tool dispatch for all three servers.

Every `@mcp.tool` coroutine in ms_inspect, ms_modify, and ms_create funnels
through `run_tool()`. It provides three things that must not diverge between
the read, write, and ingest servers:

1. **Off-loop execution.** Tool functions are synchronous and can run for
   minutes (a bandpass solve, a FLAG column read). `asyncio.to_thread` keeps
   them off the event loop so the server stays responsive.
2. **Per-path serialization.** CASA table access is not thread-safe for
   concurrent opens of the same MS within one process.
3. **A uniform error envelope.** RadioMSError becomes the documented error
   dict (design_docs/DESIGN.md §7.2); anything else propagates to FastMCP.

No CASA dependency.

    Execute a tool function off the event loop thread; return JSON-encoded result.

    Concurrent calls against the same resource path are serialized via a per-path

    image, or caltable), which is the convention every tool `run()` follows.
    Pass `_lock_path` explicitly for the few tools whose first argument is not
    the resource (e.g. `reduction_log.run(action, workdir, ...)`).

    Tools with neither a positional argument nor `_lock_path` run unserialized.

    The convention is checked, not assumed: a key that is neither an existing
    path nor path-shaped raises, rather than silently locking on something
    meaningless. Failing open would drop serialization for that tool and surface
    later as an intermittent CASA crash under concurrency — far harder to
    diagnose than the error below. A path-shaped key that does not exist is
    passed through untouched, so a mistyped MS path still reaches the tool's own
