tools/workflow_status.py — ms_workflow_status

Rolls up the state of an MS + workdir into a single next-step label.

The stage state comes from workdir/stage_log.jsonl, which the generated
scripts append to as they complete. It used to be inferred from the filesystem
with a hardcoded list of caltable names — ["delay.K", "bandpass.B", "gain.G",
"gain.fluxscaled"]. That could never work: the caltable path is an ARGUMENT to
every writing tool, with no default, so the names belong to the caller. On the
2026-08-31 G55 run this tool looked for those four while the run had written
delay.K, bandpass.b, gain.g and flux.fluxscale, reported one caltable out of
four, and froze next_recommended_step at apply_initial_rflag_then_applycal for
ten turns.

Two kinds of fact, kept apart on purpose:

- The stage log says which stages COMPLETED. It is history, written by the job
  that did the work. Nothing else can supply this — an MS on disk does not
  record which tool produced it.
- The MS probes (intents, CORRECTED_DATA) say what is TRUE NOW. A live read
  beats a log line if someone deleted a column after the fact.

A workdir with no stage log reads as nothing done. That is deliberate: the
system assumes the reduction is driven end to end by these tools. It does mean
a workdir created before the stage log existed cannot be resumed here.
