tools/pol_cal_conditions.py — ms_pol_cal_conditions

Measures the polarisation-calibration *conditions* of a dataset. It does not
decide whether polarisation calibration should proceed: that depends on the
science goal (how small a fractional polarisation is being claimed) and on the
risk tolerance, neither of which is visible from the MS.

What it reports:
1. Band centre frequency (median of SPW 0 channel frequencies).
2. Which observed fields match the bundled VLA pol calibrator catalogue, and
   their polarisation properties interpolated to the observed frequency.
3. The effective role of each catalogued source AT the observing band — a
   source's role is frequency-dependent, not fixed.
4. Parallactic-angle spread and scan count for every field, ranked, so the
   skill can pick a leakage calibrator under its own tolerance.
5. The PA reference levels in circulation, as labelled constants with
   provenance, so a caller can apply whichever one it wants.

PA convention note:
  Δ(PA) is identical in sky-frame and feed-frame because the offset between
  them is a constant per mount type. Only the absolute zero-point shifts.
  The tool reports Δ only and annotates this in pa_spread_note.
