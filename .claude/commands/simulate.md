Simulate a CASA Measurement Set based on the following description: $ARGUMENTS

Load the `ms-simulator` skill (`radio-analyst:ms-simulator` when installed as a
plugin) and follow its protocol:

1. **Parse** the description to extract telescope, config, band/frequency,
   source(s), duration, and any corruption requests.
2. **Fill defaults** for anything not specified (see 01-conversation-protocol.md).
3. **Present the simulation plan** as a parameter summary and wait for
   confirmation (unless the user said "just do it" or similar).
4. **Generate** a complete Python script using `casatools.simulator`.
5. **Execute** the script and report the result.
6. **Validate** the output MS using ms_inspect tools or listobs.
